- Verify function and class names are descriptive.
- Check that all new functions/classes include clear docstrings or comments.
- Recommend refactoring if code is duplicated or overly complex.
- Validate that unit tests cover new logic and edge cases.
- Flag any hard-coded secrets, credentials, or API keys.
- Check for performance issues in loops, queries, or API calls.
- Confirm error handling is present for all external calls.
- Mention if code could use more modularization or reuse.
